Welcome to the IcyReward Project repository. This project is designed to create a fun and interactive system for tracking and redeeming rewards at IcyWorld. The IcyReward system allows park visitors to earn and redeem points using their NFC-enabled IcyBands.

# Project Description
IcyReward aims to enhance the visitor experience at IcyWorld by providing a seamless and engaging way to collect and redeem reward points. The system tracks visitors' attractions, updates their points in real-time, and allows them to redeem gifts at kiosks throughout the park.

# Vision
For the park management team at IcyWorld tasked with analyzing customer behavior, the IcyReward system serves as an integrated system that continuously tracks user attractions data on a daily basis. It offers clear diagram displays of data for selected periods of time. Park visitors benefit from more efficient operational services and a fun experience of earning reward points and redeeming gifts.

# Key Features
